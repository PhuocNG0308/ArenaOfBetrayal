About the Zama Creator Program

### **Update: Zama Creator Program Season 5 Has Concluded**

The snapshot was taken on December 14 at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth).

The leaderboards from Season 5 and previous seasons will be available [here](https://www.zama.org/programs/creator-program) soon.

We decided to end Season 5 ahead of schedule (originally planned to end December 31) to discourage bots and AI-generated content. The prize pool remains the same. Thank you to everyone who participated.

Zama will add new creator campaigns soon. We are exploring ways to incentivize genuine creators. Make to follow Zama on [X ↗](https://x.com/zama) or [Telegram ↗](https://t.me/zama_on_telegram) to get the latest news.
